\arguments{
\item{net}{the target network}

\item{data_for_simulation}{a dataframe with node-level covariates}

\item{list_feature_matrices}{a list of feature adjacency matrices}

\item{colname_vertex_id}{the name of the column that contains the node id}

\item{colname_block_membership}{the name o the column that contains the block affiliation of each node}

\item{lighthergm_results}{a lighthergm results object}

\item{type}{the type of evaluation to perform. Can take the values \code{full} or \code{within}. \code{full} performs the evaluation on all edges, and \code{within} only considers within-block edges.}

\item{ergm_control}{MCMC parameters as an instance of ergm.control}

\item{seed}{the seed to be passed to simulate_hergm}

\item{n_sim}{the number of simulations to employ for calculating goodness of fit}

\item{prevent_duplicate}{see \code{simulate_hergm}}

\item{compute_geodesic_distance}{if \code{TRUE}, the distribution of geodesic distances is also computed (considerably increases computation time on large networks. \code{FALSE} by default.)}

\item{start_from_observed}{if \code{TRUE}, MCMC uses the observed network as a starting point}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, to be passed to lower-level functions}
